### Subtask 1: Implement the foundational structure of the application
Time spent on this subtask: ~ 4 hour
Comments:
    The full time is ~4+ hour:
        I decided to let copilot do full work for me, so sometimes spend lot of time to describe what I need exact. Build the solution from scratch using console batch. There is some warm-up time to start using Copilot
        - 3+ to understand the working approach with copilot. Lot of failed attempts without any work proposal. 
        - the final attempt requires less 1 hour to build the working solution.

### Subtask 2: Implement the basic data models and database schema
Time spent on this subtask: 4h
Comments: Very helpful in the recurring operations, but from time to time can make it differently (sor example differently impelemtns same method in repository). Also need to review the resulted code in order to fix some wrong property names (BookID instead of BookId) and can generate redundant fields
